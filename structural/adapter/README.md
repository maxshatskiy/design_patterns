The adapter pattern is a structural pattern that helps make two incompatible interfaces compatible.
If we have old component for new system or new component for old system, which cannot communicate with each other
we can write an adapter.

Use case:
one of the two incompatible interfaces is either foreign or old/legacy.

Adapters allow two preexisting objects to work together, even if their interfaces are not compatible. Adapter is 
similar to cimplified decorator patter in structure. Decorators typically provide the same interface that they
replace, whereas adapters map between two different interfaces.
